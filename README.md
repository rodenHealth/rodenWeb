Having a little trouble with the labeling of the tooltip (for the lineflood), and the labeling of the axis for the radar. 


I think the lineflood looks pretty cool, and the tooltip thing seems to be a react issue. One option is to take the tooltip away and treat it similarly to the uber line graph.
